# Phase 2 Summary: End-to-End Testing Infrastructure

## Overview
Phase 2 delivers a complete testing infrastructure for the E-Commerce microservices platform, enabling automated and manual testing of all integrated services through the API Gateway.

## What Was Delivered

### 1. Comprehensive Test Documentation
**File:** `docs/PHASE2_TESTING.md`

A complete testing guide including:
- **Prerequisites**: Docker setup, infrastructure startup, database migrations
- **Test Suites**: 6 service-specific test suites with curl examples
- **Complete E-Commerce Flow**: End-to-end user journey script
- **Troubleshooting Guide**: Common issues and solutions
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing with Apache Bench
- **Success Criteria**: Clear acceptance criteria for system health

**40+ Test Scenarios Covered:**
- User registration, login, profile management
- Product CRUD operations
- Inventory stock management and availability checks
- Shopping cart operations (add, update, remove, clear)
- Order creation and management
- Payment processing, confirmation, and refunds
- Payment method management

### 2. Automated Test Suite
**File:** `tests/e2e/test-api.ps1`

A PowerShell-based automated test runner featuring:
- **20+ Test Cases**: Covers all major API endpoints
- **Health Check**: Verifies API Gateway availability before testing
- **Test Tracking**: Counts passed/failed tests with detailed reporting
- **Auto Token Management**: Automatically handles JWT tokens
- **Variable Management**: Stores and reuses IDs (user, product, order, payment)
- **Colored Output**: Green (passed), red (failed), yellow (warnings)
- **Detailed Logging**: Shows request/response data for debugging
- **Exit Codes**: Returns 0 for success, 1 for failures (CI/CD friendly)

**Test Coverage:**
```
✅ User Service (3 tests): Register, Login, Get Profile
✅ Product Service (3 tests): Create, List, Get Details
✅ Inventory Service (2 tests): Check Stock, Check Availability
✅ Order Service (5 tests): Add to Cart, Get Cart, Create Order, Get Order, List Orders
✅ Payment Service (6 tests): Process, Confirm, Get, History, Save Method, Get Methods
✅ Inventory Verification (1 test): Verify stock reserved after order
```

### 3. Quick Start Script
**File:** `scripts/quick-start-phase2.ps1`

One-command deployment and testing:
```powershell
.\scripts\quick-start-phase2.ps1
```

**Features:**
- **Docker Check**: Verifies Docker Desktop is running
- **Infrastructure Startup**: Starts PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ
- **Health Checks**: Waits for services to be healthy
- **Migrations**: Runs database migrations for all 6 services
- **Service Startup**: Starts all 7 microservices
- **Health Verification**: Checks all services are responding
- **Test Execution**: Optionally runs automated tests (`-RunTests` flag)
- **Easy Shutdown**: Stop all services with `-StopAll` flag

**Usage Examples:**
```powershell
# Start everything
.\scripts\quick-start-phase2.ps1

# Start and run tests
.\scripts\quick-start-phase2.ps1 -RunTests

# Stop all services
.\scripts\quick-start-phase2.ps1 -StopAll

# Skip Docker (for local development)
.\scripts\quick-start-phase2.ps1 -SkipDocker
```

### 4. Postman Collection
**File:** `docs/api/postman/ecommerce-phase2.postman_collection.json`

Complete API collection with:
- **40+ Endpoints**: All API Gateway routes organized by service
- **Auto Variable Management**: Automatically extracts and stores IDs
- **Bearer Token Auth**: Collection-level authentication configuration
- **Request Examples**: Pre-filled request bodies for all endpoints
- **Test Scripts**: Automatic extraction of tokens and IDs from responses

**Import to Postman:**
1. Open Postman
2. Click "Import"
3. Select file: `docs/api/postman/ecommerce-phase2.postman_collection.json`
4. Start testing!

**Collection Structure:**
```
📁 E-Commerce Microservices API

## How to Use

### Quick Start (Recommended)
```powershell
# 1. Ensure Docker Desktop is running

# 2. Run quick start script
cd d:\WorkSpace\Personal\Go\ecommerce-go-app
.\scripts\quick-start-phase2.ps1

# 3. Wait for all services to start (~30 seconds)

# 4. Run automated tests
.\tests\e2e\test-api.ps1
```

### Manual Testing with Postman
```powershell
# 1. Start services
.\scripts\quick-start-phase2.ps1

# 2. Import Postman collection
# File → Import → Select ecommerce-phase2.postman_collection.json

# 3. Follow the order:
#    - Register User
#    - Login (token auto-saved)
#    - Create Product (ID auto-saved)
#    - Add to Cart
#    - Create Order (ID auto-saved)
#    - Process Payment
#    - Confirm Payment
```

### Manual Testing with curl
```powershell
# See docs/PHASE2_TESTING.md for complete examples

# Quick example:
# 1. Register
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/register `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d '{"email":"test@test.com","password":"Pass123!","username":"test","full_name":"Test User"}'

# 2. Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d '{"email":"test@test.com","password":"Pass123!"}'

# 3. Use the token for authenticated requests
$TOKEN = "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/users/me `
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

  ├── User Service (HTTP: 8001, gRPC: 9001)
  ├── Product Service (HTTP: 8002, gRPC: 9002)
  ├── Order Service (HTTP: 8003, gRPC: 9003)

5. Create Order → Order ID (Stock Reserved)
6. Process Payment → Payment ID
7. Confirm Payment → Payment Completed
8. Verify Inventory → Stock Updated
```

## Troubleshooting

### Docker Not Running
```
❌ Error: Docker Desktop is not running!
Solution: Start Docker Desktop and try again
```

### Services Not Starting
```powershell
# Check logs
docker-compose logs -f [service-name]

# Restart specific service
docker-compose restart [service-name]

# Rebuild if needed
docker-compose up -d --build [service-name]
```

### Tests Failing
```powershell
# 1. Verify all services are healthy
.\scripts\quick-start-phase2.ps1

# 2. Check individual service health
curl http://localhost:8001/health  # User Service
curl http://localhost:8002/health  # Product Service
# ... etc

# 3. Check service logs
docker-compose logs -f api-gateway

# 4. Verify database connectivity
docker exec -it ecommerce-postgres psql -U postgres -d ecommerce
```

### Port Already in Use
```powershell
# Find process using port
netstat -ano | findstr :8000

# Kill process (replace PID)
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Or change ports in docker-compose.yaml
```

## Performance Metrics

### Expected Response Times
- Health Check: < 10ms
- User Login: < 100ms
- Product List: < 150ms
- Order Creation: < 300ms (includes inventory check)
- Payment Processing: < 500ms (includes external gateway simulation)

### Load Testing Results (Example)

Requests: 1000
Concurrency: 50
Success Rate: 100%
Average Response Time: 120ms
Min: 45ms
Max: 350ms
```

- Implement RBAC for admin endpoints
- Add input validation and sanitization
- Setup HTTPS/TLS

### Phase 5: Production Readiness
- Setup CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions)
- Add Kubernetes manifests
- Implement blue-green deployment

## Conclusion

Phase 2 delivers a **production-grade testing infrastructure** that enables:
- **Rapid Development**: Automated tests catch regressions immediately
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive test coverage across all services
- **Easy Onboarding**: New developers can test the system in minutes
- **CI/CD Ready**: Test scripts can be integrated into pipelines
- **Documentation**: Clear guides for manual and automated testing

The system is now **fully testable, documented, and ready for integration testing**. All 7 microservices communicate properly through the API Gateway, and the complete E-Commerce flow (register → browse → cart → order → payment) works end-to-end.
